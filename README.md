# LCP_Project

This project is a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life implemented trough a jupyter notebook. 
The project is divided in to two parts: the visualization that can be found in the Game.ipynb file, and the statistical part in STATISTICAL.ipynb


In the Game.ipynb file we have implemented a pygame simulation that show the interaction between cells and a bunch of interesting information that can be deduced from it.

In the STATISTICAL.ipynb file we have showed the result of different simulations that is stored in the Data folder.

In the end, we have some utility functions that we used in both files in the script support.py. A dictionary with some import figures as well as a function to store the information can be found in organism.py
